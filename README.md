# COLOR-MATCHING
作品概念诠释 我们这个项目有关色彩搭配的，是基于消费者对甜品颜色搭配的需求而推进的，站在商家角度给予了消费者自主权，以及选择权，增加购物欲望以及消费满意度，从而提升销量，我们所针对的人群时对蛋糕甜品等有消费欲望，或是购买蛋糕时对颜色搭配没有很明确的想法的。我们通过顾客选择的基础色调，给顾客进行推荐不同的颜色搭配，以及颜色所占比例，可以根据顾客的需求进行一定的调整，我们的核心功能就是颜色推荐，可应用于甜品店，蛋糕店等，可根据商家需求整改。 The application of color in our project is promoted based on consumers' demand for dessert color matching. From the perspective of merchants, consumers are given autonomy and choice to increase shopping desire and consumer satisfaction, thereby increasing sales volume. The people we target sometimes have a desire for cake desserts, etc., or have no clear idea about color matching when buying cakes. We recommend different color combinations and the proportion of colors to customers through the basic colors selected by customers, which can be adjusted according to the needs of customers. Our core function is color recommendation, which can be applied to dessert shops and cake shops, and can be rectified according to the needs of merchants.
